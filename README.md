# Machine learning operations - Mlops (Churn prediction)


### Problem statement
In this project the goal is to build an end to end Ml project & practice the process of MLOPS. The project is broken down into 6 main components:


1. Dataset 
2. Train a model on that dataset & track the experimentation process
3. Create a model training pipeline
4. Deploy the model in batch, web service or streaming
5. Monitor the performance of your model
6. Follow the best practices
      * Testing --> Unit, integration
      * Python:linting & formatting
      * Pre-commit hooks and makefiles
      * CI/CD (Github Actions)
      * Infrastructure as code (Terraform) 

## Technologies 

Technologies Used:

* Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure or others
* Experiment tracking tools: MLFlow, Weights & Biases, ... 
* Workflow orchestration: Prefect, Airflow, Flyte, Kubeflow, Argo, ...
* Monitoring: Evidently, WhyLabs/whylogs, ...
* CI/CD: Github actions, Gitlab CI/CD, ...
* Infrastructure as code (IaC): Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, ...







This project is done after going through the course material from [mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/MarwanH7/mlops-zoomcamp)
