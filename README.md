# Machine learning operations - Mlops (Churn prediction)

### Introduction 
In this repository, after completing the [Mlops-Zoomcap](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp), I will further develop my Data Science Capstone project, which focuses on predicting telecom customer churn. In the field of data science, this problem can be approached as a classification challenge.

Throughout this project, I've always kept the business value of my solution in mind, from its inception as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to its "final iteration." The primary idea is to deploy a model that will be utilized by various internal teams that interact with clients, such as marketing, sales, and customer service. As they access customer records, they will receive a churn probability rating, categorized as high, medium, or low.

For more details about the project, including the problem statement, solution, project objectives, and project workflow (covering Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Development, Model Evaluation, and Deployment, along with the intended users), you can refer to the original repository [here](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Churn-Prediction)


### The Goal

In this project, the goal is to build an end-to-end ML project and practice the MLOps process. The project is structured into six main components:

1. **Dataset**: Acquire and prepare the dataset.
2. **Train a model**: Train a model using the dataset and track the experimentation process.
3. **Create a model training pipeline**: Set up a pipeline for training the model.
4. **Deploy the model**: Deploy the model using batch processing, web services, or streaming.
5. **Monitor the model's performance**: Keep track of the model's performance over time.
6. **Follow best practices**, including:
   - Testing (unit and integration testing).
   - Python linting and formatting.
   - Implementing pre-commit hooks and makefiles.
   - Setting up CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
   - Implementing Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).



## Technologies 

**Technologies Used:**

- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure, or others
- **Experiment tracking tools**: MLFlow, Weights & Biases, and more.
- **Workflow orchestration**: Prefect, Airflow, Flyte, Kubeflow, Argo, and more.
- **Monitoring**: Evidently, WhyLabs/whylogs, and more.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Gitlab CI/CD, and more.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, and more.






This project is done after going through the course material from [mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/MarwanH7/mlops-zoomcamp)
